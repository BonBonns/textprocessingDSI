To add:

1) summary.cpp
	computes word frequency
		word, #occurances, #docs
	computes doc tokens
		number of words per document

2) sparsity.py
	reads in word frequency file
	input argument is sparsity or ntokens
	returns list of words to keep

3) filter.py
	reads in list of words
	goes through the documents and keeps only those words


external:
	lemma.sh (takes single file)
	clean.py 
rcpp:
	join.cpp --done
	split.cpp --done
	summary.cpp
	filter.cpp
	
R package: text-processing
	has functions:
------- 	join_corpus (ipath, corpus)
			calls join.cpp which reads all files in directory and saves to one big file
			returns ordered list of filenames
------- 	split_corpus (ipath, opath, size, lines, or nchunks)
			calls split.cpp with Rcpp

-------		clean_corpus (ipath, opath, ncores, clean-commands-string)
			does parlapply (over all files in ipath) of clean_file 

-------		clean_file (ifilepath, ofilepath, clean-commands-string)
			maybe path to clean and lemma executables and then system call to that path
			makes system call to clean.py
			potentially makes systemcall to lemma.sh (takes single file as input)

		summary_corpus (ipath, ncores)
			does parlapply (over all files in ipath) of summary_file with ncores
			then combines data and calculates some metrics (maybe even dan's ndH)

		summary_file (ifilepath)
			calls summary.cpp

		filter_corpus (ipath, ncores, wordlist)
			does parlapply (over all files in ipath) of filter_file  

		filter_file (ifilepath, wordlist)
			calls filter.cpp

Potential problems - the clean.py and lemma.sh bottleneck. what if we want to change those? guess edit the source, 
			how can you do that when importing the library?
		think this through then email duncan with the basic idea
			
			

given input corpus in many files:
  -clean_corpus
  -summary_corpus
  -filter_corpus
  -summary_corpus
  -join_corpus (convert to newline delim)


given input corpus in way too many small files:
  -join_corpus (convert to newline delim)
  -split_corpus
  -clean_corpus (newline delim)
  -summary_corpus (newline delim)
  -filter_corpus
  -join_corpus (don't need to specify newline delim)
